## 📌 **Course Overview**  
This course builds upon the foundations of machine learning, introducing critical techniques for handling missing data, categorical variables, model validation, and performance optimization.  

### **Key Learnings & Topics**  
1. **Missing Values** – Strategies to handle missing data and maintain model performance.  
2. **Categorical Variables** – Encoding techniques to transform non-numeric data into meaningful inputs.  
3. **Pipelines** – Automating data preprocessing and model training for efficient workflows.  
4. **Cross-Validation** – Improving model evaluation for better generalization.  
5. **XGBoost** – Implementing one of the most powerful ML algorithms for structured data.  
6. **Data Leakage** – Identifying and preventing issues that can silently degrade model accuracy.
